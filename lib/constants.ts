  bio: {
    short: "CRTA certified red team analyst with over one year of professional experience at Levithan Technologies. Specializing in offensive security, red team operations, and penetration testing across web, mobile, Active Directory, and cloud environments. Actively building offensive security tooling and preparing for OSCP and CEH certifications.",
    
    paragraph1: "I'm a CRTA (Certified Red Team Analyst) with over one year of hands-on experience in offensive security and red team operations at Levithan Technologies. My work focuses on breaking systems before attackers do—through web application pentesting, mobile security assessments, Active Directory exploitation, and cloud security testing. I've worked on government and enterprise security projects, conducting real-world vulnerability assessments, exploit development, and adversary simulation exercises.",
    
    paragraph2: "Beyond formal engagements, I build practical offensive security tools—automated reconnaissance utilities, phishing detection systems, OSINT pipelines, and custom exploitation frameworks. My approach is attack-focused: I study real-world attack paths, privilege escalation techniques, lateral movement strategies, and post-exploitation methods to understand how adversaries actually operate. Currently preparing for OSCP and CEH, I'm committed to advancing my skills in advanced penetration testing and red team operations. I bridge the gap between theoretical security knowledge and what attackers actually do in the wild."
