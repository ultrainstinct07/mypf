  bio: {
    short: "Cybersecurity analyst with over one year of full-time experience at Levithan Technologies, specializing in web application security, mobile application pentesting, and red-team methodology. CRTA certified, actively building security tools, and preparing for OSCP and CEH certifications.",
    
    paragraph1: "Kshitiz Kumar is a cybersecurity analyst with over one year of full-time experience at Levithan Technologies, specializing in web application security, mobile application pentesting, and red-team methodology. His work spans vulnerability assessment, exploit development basics, reconnaissance workflows, and hands-on security testing for government and enterprise environments.",
    
    paragraph2: "He holds the CRTA (Certified Red Team Analyst) certification, demonstrating his capability in adversary simulation, privilege escalation, lateral movement, and post-exploitation techniques. Beyond formal work, he actively builds tools and internal solutions, including automated reconnaissance utilities, phishing detection systems, and OSINT-driven intelligence modules. His learning path is heavily focused on red teaming and offensive security engineering. He is currently preparing for OSCP and CEH, aiming to complete both certifications next year as part of his progression into advanced offensive cybersecurity and penetration testing roles. He enjoys working at the intersection of threat simulation, real-world attack modeling, and practical defense improvement—bridging the gap between theoretical security and what attackers actually do."
