## Overview

A comprehensive collection of mobile application security assessments covering Android and iOS platforms. This project documents methodologies, findings, and remediation strategies for common mobile security vulnerabilities.

## Testing Methodology

### Reconnaissance Phase

#### Static Analysis
- APK/IPA decompilation and reverse engineering
- Source code review (when available)
- AndroidManifest.xml / Info.plist analysis
- Library and SDK inventory
- Hardcoded secrets detection

#### Dynamic Analysis
- Runtime behavior monitoring
- Network traffic interception
- API endpoint discovery
- File system inspection
- Debugger attachment

### OWASP Mobile Top 10 Coverage

#### M1: Improper Platform Usage
- Misuse of Android/iOS platform features
- Intent hijacking on Android
- URL scheme abuse on iOS
- Insecure data storage in shared preferences

#### M2: Insecure Data Storage
- Unencrypted local databases (SQLite)
- Sensitive data in shared preferences
- Insecure file permissions
- Cached data exposure
- Backup file analysis

#### M3: Insecure Communication
- Missing certificate pinning
- Weak TLS configuration
- Cleartext HTTP traffic
- WebSocket security
- Deep link handling

#### M4: Insecure Authentication
- Weak password policies
- Insecure session management
- Biometric authentication bypass
- OAuth implementation flaws

#### M5: Insufficient Cryptography
- Weak encryption algorithms (DES, RC4)
- Hardcoded encryption keys
- Predictable random number generation
- Improper key storage

#### M6: Insecure Authorization
- Privilege escalation vulnerabilities
- Insecure direct object references
- Function-level authorization bypass
- Role-based access control flaws

#### M7: Client Code Quality
- Buffer overflows
- Format string vulnerabilities
- SQL injection in local databases
- XSS in WebViews

#### M8: Code Tampering
- Missing root/jailbreak detection
- Absence of code obfuscation
- No integrity checks
- Debugging flags left enabled

#### M9: Reverse Engineering
- Lack of code obfuscation
- Exposed API keys and secrets
- Business logic vulnerabilities
- Algorithm and encryption analysis

#### M10: Extraneous Functionality
- Hidden backdoors
- Debug functionality in production
- Test endpoints exposed
- Developer comments with sensitive info

## Tools & Techniques

### Android Testing

#### Frida Scripts
Dynamic instrumentation for runtime analysis:
```javascript
// Bypass SSL Pinning
Java.perform(function() {
    var CertificatePinner = Java.use('okhttp3.CertificatePinner');
    CertificatePinner.check.overload('java.lang.String', 'java.util.List')
        .implementation = function(str, list) {
            console.log('[+] SSL Pinning bypassed for: ' + str);
            return;
        };
});
```

#### Objection
Runtime mobile exploration toolkit:
- SSL pinning bypass
- Root detection bypass
- Activity and service enumeration
- Keystore dumping

#### MobSF (Mobile Security Framework)
- Automated static analysis
- Dynamic analysis capabilities
- CVSS score generation
- Compliance checking

### iOS Testing

#### Jailbreak Detection Bypass
Techniques for circumventing jailbreak checks:
- Substrate/Frida hooks
- Binary patching
- Runtime manipulation

#### Keychain Analysis
Secure credential storage inspection:
- Keychain dumping
- Access control list (ACL) analysis
- Inter-app data sharing review

### Network Testing

#### Burp Suite Mobile Configuration
- Certificate installation
- Proxy configuration
- SSL/TLS interception
- WebSocket testing

#### Certificate Pinning Bypass
Multiple approaches documented:
- Frida scripts
- Objection automation
- Manual patching
- SSL Kill Switch

### Reverse Engineering Mitigation
- Code obfuscation (ProGuard, R8, Swift Obfuscator)
- Anti-tampering checks
- Root/jailbreak detection
- Debugger detection
- Integrity verification
