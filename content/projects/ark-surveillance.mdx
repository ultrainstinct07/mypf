## Overview

Ark Surveillance is a privacy-focused AI surveillance system that performs real-time face recognition without relying on cloud services. The system is designed to run entirely on local infrastructure, ensuring that sensitive biometric data never leaves the premises.

## Key Features

### Local-First Architecture
- All processing happens on-device or on-premises servers
- No data transmission to external services
- Complete control over biometric data storage and processing

### Real-Time Face Recognition
- Uses TensorFlow for deep learning-based face detection
- OpenCV for video stream processing
- Achieves 30+ FPS on modern hardware
- Handles multiple camera feeds simultaneously

### Privacy & Security
- Encrypted database for face embeddings
- Role-based access control
- Audit logging for all system access
- GDPR-compliant data handling

## Technical Implementation

### Computer Vision Pipeline
The system uses a multi-stage pipeline:
1. **Frame Capture**: Optimized video capture from RTSP/HTTP streams
2. **Face Detection**: MTCNN-based face detection with bounding boxes
3. **Face Alignment**: Geometric normalization for consistent embeddings
4. **Feature Extraction**: FaceNet-based 128-dimensional embeddings
5. **Recognition**: k-NN classification with similarity thresholding

### Performance Optimization
- GPU acceleration with CUDA support
- Multi-threaded frame processing
- Efficient frame skipping for low-priority feeds
- Redis caching for frequently accessed embeddings

## Security Considerations

### Threat Model
- Prevents unauthorized access through multi-factor authentication
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks
- Secure communication via TLS 1.3

### Data Protection
- Face embeddings stored using AES-256 encryption
- Automatic data retention policies
- Secure deletion protocols for removed subjects
- Access logs maintained for forensic analysis

## Deployment

The system supports multiple deployment scenarios:
- Single-machine setup for small installations
- Distributed architecture for enterprise deployments
- Docker Compose for easy orchestration
- Kubernetes manifests for cloud-native deployments

## Lessons Learned

Building Ark Surveillance taught me the importance of balancing performance with privacy. Key takeaways include:
- Privacy-preserving systems can match cloud-based performance
- Local deployment requires careful resource planning
- User trust is paramount in biometric systems
- Compliance frameworks guide better security design

## Future Enhancements

- Support for additional biometric modalities
- Federated learning for privacy-preserving model updates
- Integration with existing SIEM systems
- Mobile app for real-time alerts
